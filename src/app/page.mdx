# Course Overview

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process.
Students will learn methods and skills for designing and prototyping interactive systems.
The course covers a design process from the initial formulation of a design problem to creation of digital prototypes.
Importantly, the course does not emphasize development but instead fully focuses on design.

The course structure is a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, and design critiques by peers and course staff.
The course is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

- Ideate and Propose Design Problems
- Study Existing Practices and Challenges
- Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
- Evaluate and Iterate Upon a Design
- Communicate a Problem and Resulting Design

## Learning Objectives

- Process-Focused Perspective on Interaction Design
- Design Research Methods and Skills
- Task-Focused Scenario Development, Sketching, and Storyboarding
- Rapid Prototyping and Iteration
- Critical Perspective on Design Solutions

</TBD>

Each Project Milestone will consist of several Assignments and culminate in a Milestone Report.
Assignments will be graded for completion of key components listed in the Assignment spec.

Each Milestone Report will be predominantly composed of material you produced for that Milestone's Assignments,
with some additional work of editing and revising the previously submitted content
and providing reflection on your design process.
Each Milestone Report will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded.
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
The stated project requirements are the minimum,
intended to leave room for groups to earn strong grades through strong work.

Because the course is designed around feedback on each Assignment, grades given to those Assignments indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the submission.
You will also receive lightweight feedback on each Assignment's key components in the form of a quality rating.
These ratings will not affect your grade, but indicate where you should invest effort to revise your materials
as you progress in your design and assemble your materials for the Milestone Report.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the Milestone Reports and final deliverables, 
which are evaluated on their quality.

Assignment quality ratings are on a scale from one to four stars and can roughly be interepreted as follows:
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐: High quality work; does not need additional attention.
- ⭐⭐⭐: Decent quality work; good, but there is still room for improvement.
- ⭐⭐: Ok quality work; on the right track, but could benefit from substantial development and revision.
- ⭐: Poor quality work; does not accomplish the intended goal and needs a lot more work. 
  If you don't know why you're getting this score, we encourage you to reach out to the course staff.

### Late Policy
We generally expect all assignments will be submitted according to the deadline in Canvas and the assignment description.
This is a fast-paced course, with many elements of the project depending on prior elements.
The course staff's ability to give feedback also relies on timely submissions
(e.g., course staff will often review submissions soon after they are submitted to be ready for course activities).

If your group feels that you would really benefit from an extension,
or if there is an emergency impacting your ability to submit an assignment,
contact the course staff before the submission deadline.

We will do our best to be flexible and work with you so that your group stays on track.
Extensions of a few hours can often be facilitated.
Except in extreme circumstances, we will typically not be able to give an extension of more than 1 day.

### Regrade Policy
Any request for grade clarification or a re-grade must be submitted via the course staff email list.
Requests will only be considered within 7 days of the release of a grade.

Upon calculation of final grades, we will explicitly check for any particularly unfortunate effects of rounding
(e.g., adjusting a pre-rounding final grade of 3.649 to instead give a 3.7).
This is intended to provide peace of mind that final grades were not defined by any minor point deduction.

## Participation and COVID-19 Safety

Our goal is for this course to provide an opportunity for learning without undermining wellness or safety.
Active participation in activities is central to this course,
and we all share responsibility for preserving safety of this learning environment.
Please review and adhere to related policies, including
[UW COVID-19 Illness and Exposure Guidance](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-prevention-and-response/covid-19-illness-and-exposure-guidance).

### Expectation of In-Person Participation

The course heavily emphasizes a group project and participation in associated in-class activities.
In-person participation is expected for both lecture and section,
is part of participation grading,
and can also impact grading of your contribution to the group project.

### Remote Participation and Recordings

There may be reasons you cannot or should not attend in-person
(e.g., COVID exposure, COVID symptoms).
In these circumstances, contact the course staff for permission to attend remotely.
If you are unsure whether you should attend,
please reach out and know that we will do our best to be accommodating.
Our goal is to encourage and support you in decisions that preserve everybody's safety.

Students with permission may attend via the Zoom link provided in <CourseStoreLink linkKey="linkCanvas">Canvas</CourseStoreLink>.
A member of the course staff will also aim to monitor the Zoom chat for questions.
If class splits into project group activities,
the Zoom meeting will end and remote students should join their group
via a video call with a member of their group.

We will also use the in-room Panopto system to record lecture components of the course.
This can support review of material, but is not a substitute for in-person activities.

## Accommodations and University Policies

Additional university policies apply
(e.g., regarding Academic Integrity, Conduct, Disability Resources, Face Coverings, Religious Accommodations):
