# Assignment 3.1: Task Review

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_1} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

Old 2D Goal:

The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and learned in your design research,
organizing observations around themes and developing insights into tasks that can help inform your design.

Old 2E Goal:

The goal of this milestone is to develop a set of tasks that you will explore in a set of potential designs.

Old 2D Task Analysis:

#### Task Analysis Questions

Informed by your design research, provide brief answers to the following questions.
These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.

1. Who is going to use the design?
2. What tasks do they now perform?
3. What tasks are desired?
4. How are the tasks learned?
5. Where are the tasks performed?
6. What is the relationship between the person and data?
7. What other tools does the person have?
8. How do people communicate with each other?
9. How often are the tasks performed?
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
11. What happens when things go wrong?

Old 2E Tasks:

The goal of this milestone is to develop a set of tasks that you will explore in a set of potential designs.

Building on what you learned in your design research, design __six tasks__ that you believe are important to your design goal:

- Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it.
- Select tasks to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage of designs you will explore.
- Create tasks based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks (i.e., tasks people already do)
  as well as your vision for new tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your potential designs).
- These should be real world tasks that include details
  (e.g., instead of "programming a DVR", details like "programming a DVR to record Spongebob on Sundays").
  Such details can then be explored in scenarios with the potential designs you will develop in later milestones.
- Tasks should not have any specific relation to the potential designs you will develop in later milestones.
  Although it can be helpful to describe a task in the context of a specific scenario,
  the task itself should be more general and potentially achieved using multiple potential designs.
- Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty.

Each task should be presented as a bolded sentence at the beginning of a paragraph,
concisely conveying a problem and/or what is accomplished.
The remainder of the paragraph should then present
additional details, potential scenarios, or a step-by-step walkthrough with specific designs.

As you progress in your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks.
Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive.
The tasks you develop in this milestone therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.

## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_1} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
  Edit the deck in-place, so that you can easily share it in critique.

- Prepare a Slide deck with the following structure:

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>
  For each Design Research Activity (at least 2):
    - 1/2 slide: Participant details.
    - 1/2 slide: Method details.
    - 3 slides: 6 design research findings (i.e., 2 per slide).
</Alert>

Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

  - Export a PDF of your deck, via the menu: File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf).

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your design research and tasks.

## Completion Grading

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>
This assignment will be graded on completion of __3 components__:

1. __Participant and Method Details__

   Provide details that convey why participants are relevant.

   Convey aspects of your method that are most important to understand as context for your findings.

2. __Specific Findings and Supporting Evidence__

   Present specific findings based on what you heard, learned, or observed.

   In support of each finding, provide specific evidence collected in your design research.

3. __Clarity and Presentation__
