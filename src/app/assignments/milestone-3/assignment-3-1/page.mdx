# Assignment 3.1: Task Review

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_1} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to build on what you learned in your design research to develop a set of tasks
that you will explore in your upcoming designs.

Informed by your design research, provide brief answers to the following task analysis questions.
These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.

1. Who is going to use the design?
2. What tasks do they now perform?
3. What tasks are desired?
4. How are the tasks learned?
5. Where are the tasks performed?
6. What is the relationship between the person and data?
7. What other tools does the person have?
8. How do people communicate with each other?
9. How often are the tasks performed?
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
11. What happens when things go wrong?


After completing your task analysis, design __six tasks__ that you believe are important to your design goal:

- Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it.
- Select tasks to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage 
  of designs you will explore.
- Create tasks based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks (i.e., tasks people already do)
  as well as your vision for new tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your potential designs).
- These should be real world tasks that include details
  (e.g., instead of "programming a DVR", details like "programming a DVR to record Spongebob on Sundays").
  Such details can then be explored in scenarios with the potential designs you will develop in later milestones.
- Tasks should not have any specific relation to the potential designs you will develop in later milestones.
  Although it can be helpful to describe a task in the context of a specific story,
  the task itself should be more general and potentially achieved using multiple potential designs.
- Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty.

Each task should be presented as a brief summary sentence concisely conveying 
a problem and/or what is accomplished, followed by a paragraph containing additional details. 
These details might be based on what you found in your design research or your task analysis, 
such as certain goals or values of your audience, the context in which the task is performed, 
or a potential story walking through what a person *wants* to do, but not specifically *how* 
they accomplish their goal.

As you progress in your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks.
Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive.
The tasks you develop in this milestone therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.


## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_1} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
  Edit the deck in-place, so that you can easily share it in critique.

- Prepare a Slide deck with the following structure:

  - 1/2 slide for each Task Analysis Question (5.5 slides total)
  - 1 slide for each of your proposed tasks, consisting of:
    - A concise statement of your task
    - Additional details & context surrounding the task

Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

  - Export a PDF of your deck, via the menu: File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf).
