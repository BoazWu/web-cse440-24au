# Assignment 3.4: Scenarios and Storyboards

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_4} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to choose a design direction to pursue in the remainder of this course.
You will select a design direction, choose two focus tasks as your emphasis,
and sketch task walkthroughs showing how your focus tasks are accomplished with your selected design.

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

__Select a design__ to pursue in the remainder of this course.
This might be a design that you presented in Assignment 3.2,
or it might be a new design you have developed after consideration of potential design directions.
Sketch key aspects of the design needed to illustrate its approach to your tasks.

__Select two focus__ tasks to pursue in the remainder of this course.
These might be tasks that you presented in Assignment 3.2,
or they might be new tasks you have developed after consideration of potential design directions.

Prepare one paragraph describing your rationale for the selected design.
For example, address what makes your selected design more compelling to pursue than your other designs.
Prepare another paragraph describing your rationale for the selected focus tasks.
For example, address what makes your selected tasks more compelling to pursue than your other tasks.
In both paragraphs, draw upon data from your design research and feedback from critiques.
Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks you chose, and why you chose them.

For each focus task, __create a storyboard__
conveying context and detail around interaction with your design.
A storyboard should include one or more characters and settings,
should establish motivation and satisfaction,
and should provide insight into the design and the task.
Storyboards should not include unnecessary details or frames.
As needed, ensure clarity of your story through captions,
other brief descriptions, selective use of color, or other techniques.

For each focus task, also develop a step-by-step __task walkthrough__.
This should focus on the design itself, sketching each significant step in accomplishing the task.
This will typically be a sequence of images,
with each image annotated to indicate how a person moves forward in the walkthrough.
Your focus task provides the context for sketching this additional level of detail in your design,
and your task walkthroughs should aim to be sufficient as the starting point for developing a paper prototype.

## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_3_4} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
  Edit the deck in-place, so that you can easily share it in critique.

- Prepare a Slide deck with the following structure:

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

  Selected Design
    - 1 slide: Current design problem.
    - 1 slide: Design title and brief description of its key idea or approach.
    - 1 slide: Sketches illustrating the overall design approach.
    - 1 slide: Selected focus tasks and rationale for selected design and focus tasks.

  For each focus task (2 total):
    - 1 slide: Focus task title and storyboard.
    - Multiple slides: Sketches of a step-by-step task walkthrough with the selected design.

</Alert>

Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

  - Export a PDF of your deck, via the menu: File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf).

#### In Class

Be prepared use your focus task walkthroughs to begin developing a paper prototype of your design.

## Completion Grading

This assignment will be graded on completion of the following components:

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

{/*

1. __Current Design Problem__

   This may be taken directly from your Milestone 2 report,
   or it may be updated if your framing of the design problem has evolved in defining tasks and exploring designs.

2. __Design Research Methods & Participants Overview__

   This will be a concise consolidation of overviews provided in your Milestone 2 report,
   It may also be updated with any additional design research you decided to conduct.

3. __8 Design Research Findings__

   These may be taken directly from your Milestone 2 report,
   or they may be updated because your understanding of insights has evolved in defining tasks and exploring designs.

4. __6 Tasks__

   These may be taken directly from Assignment 3.1,
   or they be updated based on feedback or understanding developed in exploring designs.

5. __3 Proposed Designs__

   Each Design should consist of:
     - Title and brief description of its key idea or approach.
     - Sketches illustrating the overall design approach.
     - Sketches illustrating design approach to 4 key tasks.

6. __Clarity and Presentation__

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __8 points__:

1. __Rationale for Choosing a Design Focus and Tasks__: (2 points)
2. __Each of 2 Storyboards__: (2 x 2 points)
3. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

## Prior Samples

<PriorSamplesWarning />

Prior offerings have not included focus task walkthroughs at this point in the project sequence.
Prior groups often used their paper prototypes to prepare such task walkthroughs in their final presentations.
We are having you sketch task walkthroughs earlier in your process,
so your task walkthroughs can both convey more of your design in Milestone 3
and help inform your development of a paper prototype in Milestone 4.
