TODO goal text that mirrors Milestone 1 but fits the scope of this milestone.

> From Milestone 1
Milestone 1 has focused on finding your design direction through a process of
developing multiple proposals,
receiving critique on each of them,
integrating that critique to prepare a final proposal,
and doing initial ideation to inform your upcoming design research.
In this milestone report, aim to communicate how you came to your design direction and why it is compelling to pursue.

   Give enough background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling.

5. __Novelty and Creativity__: (2 points)

   If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed idea,
   explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.

6. __Design Ideation__: (2 points)

   Present a set of your top design ideas and
   a few specific insights into why these ideas are potentially compelling to explore.

7. __Directions for Design Research__: (1 point)
