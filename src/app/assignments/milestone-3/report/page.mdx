# Milestone 3 Report

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this report is to communicate and reflect on
development and refinement of your tasks and designs,
culminating in your final design proposal and its two focus tasks.

You are free to directly reuse content produced for earlier assignments in this milestone.
However, you should revise content as needed to ensure your milestone report reflects your current work.
Similarly, we expect that feedback received throughout this milestone will have been addressed or implemented in this report.

Milestone 3 has focused on the development of tasks and potential designs,
with you proposing and exploring a range of design directions
and then choosing a design direction with two focus tasks.
In this milestone report, aim to communicate
this progression through considering and selecting tasks and designs,
providing rationale for the choices you made in this design process.

This report should have three sections:

1. __Design Problem and Tasks__

   __State the design problem__ you explored throughout this milestone.
   You may start with text from an earlier assignment,
   but you should revise to account for feedback and for clarity you have gained in your design exploration.
   Ensure that your description of the design problem:
   - Clearly describes a problem that people experience,
     including highlighting relevant aspects of the problem that informed your design exploration.
   - Conveys aspects of the problem,
     rather than conveying aspects of a specific design solution.
   - Remains sufficiently general to describe your exploration of multiple design alternatives.

   __Present 6 tasks__ that characterize the design space you explored throughout this milestone.
   These might be tasks you submitted in earlier assignments,
   might be tasks you have revised to better describe an earlier task,
   or might be new or re-formulated tasks that you feel influenced your design exploration.
   Ensure that each task:
   - Consists of a clear action that a person takes and which leads to an accomplishment
     (e.g., lists of design capabilities are not tasks, things that simply happen to people are not tasks).
   - Could potentially be supported by different designs
     (e.g., is not overly tied to a specific design).
   - Could potentially be pursued across different contexts and details
     (e.g., is not overly tied to a contexts or details of a specific story).

   __Reflect on these tasks__ and share insights you developed through your design exploration.
   Insights might be about the tasks themselves or about how those tasks shaped design exploration.
   For example:
   - Did certain tasks help suggest design ideas?
   - Were certain tasks more difficult to incorporate into design ideas?
   - Did different categories of tasks emerge
     (e.g., short-term versus long-term tasks, tasks focused on an individual versus tasks among a group of people)?
   - Are there interesting relationships between tasks
     (e.g., in time, in data, via dependencies)?
   - Were there tasks that worked well together or poorly together
     (e.g., a combination suggested interesting design directions, a combination was difficult to define in the same design)?
   - Did design explorations suggest consideration of other tasks
     (e.g., lead you to explore tasks at different levels of a task hierarchy,
     suggest other tasks you might have explored with more time)?

   Share __at least 3__ meaningful insights about your tasks.

2. __Proposed Designs__
   
   Present and review the 3 potential design directions you explored in Assignment 3.2 and this milestone.

   For each design, include:

   __A descriptive title and brief description__ of the key idea or approach of the design.

   __Key sketches__ that communicate the most important aspects of the design.
   This should be 2 or 3 sketches, which could include
   earlier overview sketches, earlier task sketches,
   or new sketches that better communicate the core idea or approach of the design.

   __Reflection on the design.__
   Informed by any critique you received and by your own reflection on the design,
   summarize what was more or less compelling or effective in the design.
   For example:
   - Are there elements of this design you think could or should be further explored?
   - Are there elements of this design that you intentionally chose to not further explore?
   - What informed such decisions, and what did you ultimately learn from this design?

   Note this section needs to clearly present and reflect on each design from Assignment 3.2,
   regardless of whether you chose to further pursue that design in the rest of this milestone.
   If your earlier sketches were unclear or did not effectively communicate your design,
   we strongly encourage you to create updated sketches that better capture the design idea or approach.

3. __Selected Design__

   Finally, you will present your selected design, paired with your two focus tasks. 

   Begin by introducing your design with __a compelling, memorable name__ you intend to use for
   it going forward. This should be more than just a descriptor you may have used to distinguish
   the design in Assignment 3.2-- think critically about how you can communicate key aspects of
   your design in just a few words.

   Additionally, provide a two-paragraph description of the problem your design aims to solve 
   (Paragraph 1) and the key approach your design takes to address this problem (Paragraph 2).
   Ensure this description is concise while still providing sufficient detail to an audience
   who has not heard about your project before.

   Present each of your focus tasks and the associated storyboard (revised from Assignment 3.4
   as needed). Ensure that each focus task is clearly stated and that your storyboard presents 
   a compelling narrative involving a problem, at least one character, a clear interaction 
   between a character and your design, and a final outcome that indicates satisfaction
   and explains how the problem was addressed. 
   Be particularly mindful of how you balance conciseness and clarity in each storyboard.

   Next, explain the rationale for selecting your design and your focus tasks. Be sure to speak
   affirmatively about why *this* design and *these* tasks are **good**, not just why the options
   you did not pursue were worse.

   Also discuss the relationship between your design and your tasks and why they "make sense" together. 
   For instance:
   - What synergy exists between your design and tasks? 
   - How do your tasks enable you to explore a meaningful space in this design and tell 
     a compelling story?
   - Are there tasks or portions of your problem not captured by your focus tasks 
     that you intentionally chose not to focus on because of the goals of this design?

   Finally, close by presenting specific details of how you intend to support your tasks
   in this design. For each focus task, share sketches or select frames from your task walkthroughs 
   (from Assignment 3.4) that show your current concept of what the interaction actually looks like.

   Briefly reflect on what you currently know or don't know about your design:
   - What specific elements of the design became clear through producing your task walkthrough?
   - What aspects of this design are still open or uncertain? 
   - What portions of the design do you want to focus on most during the upcoming design refinement
     and usability testing?


{/*

   you kept portions of this proposed design: what portions did you keep and why?
    - If you made an intentional choice to not explore any parts of this design going forward:
      what informed that decision? What did you ultimately learn from this design?
    - If you selected this design: what insights made you decide this was a good design to
      explore further? (Note that "we didn't like our other ideas" is *not* a sufficient
      rationale-- what makes this design *good?*)


   Following each design, reflect on the critique you received on the design and present your own
   reflection on how you considered it in your final design selection.
   For instance:


   on what did or didn't work with the design. Regardless of whether you chose to pursue
   this design or not, what did the process of developing this design contribute to your
   selected design?


   *Note: If your previously submitted sketches were unclear or did not effectively
        communicate your design, we strongly encourage you to create updated sketches here.*

   *Note: even for the designs you opted not to pursue, ensure that your description and
   sketches still clearly demonstrate the initial vision of each design, revising materials
   from Assignment 3.2 if needed.*
