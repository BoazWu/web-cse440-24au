# Milestone 3 Report

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

The goal of this report is to communicate the story of how you developed and refined your tasks and designs,
leading up to a final design proposal with two focus tasks.

You are free to directly reuse content produced for earlier assignments in this milestone.
However, you should revise content as needed to ensure your milestone report reflects your current work.
Similarly, we expect that feedback received throughout this milestone will have been addressed or implemented in this report.



Milestone 3 has focused on the development of a set of tasks and potential designs,
encompassing a full cycle of the design diamond (proposing a wide range of ideas, 
then narrowing down to a single design with two focus tasks).
In this milestone report, focus on demonstrating this progression, providing rationale for the choices
made at each step along the way.


This report should have three sections:

1. __Tasks__

   To begin, review __all__ the tasks you have proposed throughout this milestone that did NOT
   ultimately become a focus task.
   For each of these tasks, briefly reflect on why you opted not to pursue it, or, if it influenced
   or was incorporated into one of your focus tasks, explain what it contributed and how you
   evolved it.

   (Note: depending how many tasks you have considered, you may choose to provide more or or less
   detail on each task. Aim for roughly 12-15 sentences of reflection total.)

   Then, present each of your focus tasks.
   For each focus task, provide a clear task statement, coupled with an illustrative task story 
   (comparable to what you presented in Assignment 3.1). 

   Additionally, provide a rationale for your two focus tasks, describing how they effectively represent
   the insights from your design research and how they define a valuable design space to explore 
   in the remainder of your design process.

2. __Proposed Designs__
   
   Begin by presenting each of your designs from Assignment 3.2, including your overview sketch, 
   selected tasks, and each of your task sketches.
   
   *Note: even for the designs you opted not to pursue, ensure that your description and 
   sketches still clearly demonstrate the initial vision of each design, revising materials
   from Assignment 3.2 if needed.* 

   Following each design, reflect on the critique you received on the design and present your own
   reflection on how you considered it in your final design selection.
   For instance:
    - If you kept portions of this proposed design: what portions did you keep and why?
    - If you made an intentional choice to not explore any parts of this design going forward:
      what informed that decision? What did you ultimately learn from this design?
    - If you selected this design: what insights made you decide this was a good design to
      explore further? (Note that "we didn't like our other ideas" is *not* a sufficient
      rationale-- what makes this design *good?*)


3. __Selected Design__

   Finally, present your selected design, paired with your two focus tasks. 
   Begin by sharing your design overview sketch and summary description of your design.

   Then, explain the relationship between your design and your focus tasks.
   What synergy exists between your design and tasks? How do your tasks enable you to explore a
   meaningful space in this design and tell a compelling story? Are there tasks or portions of
   your problem not captured by your focus tasks that you intentionally chose not to focus on?
   Why did you choose this focus? 

   Next, present each of your tasks.
   Begin each task by sharing the corresponding storyboard. Ensure that your storyboard 
   establishes motivation and satisfaction and provides insight into the design and the task.

   Follow each storyboard with your task walkthrough sketches, clearly communicating 
   key aspects of the design itself by sketching each significant step in accomplishing the task.

   Close each task by reflecting on what is still uncertain in how your design supports this task, 
   and what specific facets of the design you might choose to explore further in your 
   usability testing and design refinement.

    - 2 slides: Focus tasks (1 slide per task).
    - 1 slide: Focus task rationale/reflection.

  Proposed Designs
    Each Design should consist of:
     - 1 slide: Title and brief description of its key idea or approach.
     - 1 slide: Sketches illustrating the overall design approach.
     - 2 slides: Sketches illustrating design approach to 4 key tasks (1/2 slide per task).
     - 1 slide: Design reflection.

  Selected Design
    - 1 slide: Selected design title & summary.
    - 1 slide: Selected design overview sketch.
    - 1 slide: Focus tasks & rationale.

## Grading

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

{/*
This milestone report will be graded on a scale of __20 points__:

1. __Initial Proposals and Critique__: (3 x 1 point)

   Share each proposal, with appropriate summary of and reflection on critique of that proposal.

2. __Reflection on Initial Proposals__: (2 point)

   Provide meaningful insight into rationale for pursuing your final proposal,
   including your decisions and what informed those decisions.

3. __Final Proposal - Problem and Motivation__: (4 points)

   Provide enough detail to convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.

4. __Final Proposal - Analysis of Problem__: (4 points)

   Give enough background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling.

5. __Novelty and Creativity__: (2 points)

   If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed idea,
   explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.

6. __Design Ideation__: (2 points)

   Present a set of your top design ideas and
   a few specific insights into why these ideas are potentially compelling to explore.

7. __Directions for Design Research__: (1 point)

   Provide meaningful ideas for people, focus, and method to consider in design research.

8. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)
