# Milestone 3 Report

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_3_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this report is to communicate the story of how you developed and refined your tasks and designs,
leading up to a final design proposal with two focus tasks.

You are free to directly reuse content produced for earlier assignments in this milestone.
However, you should revise content as needed to ensure your milestone report reflects your current work.
Similarly, we expect that feedback received throughout this milestone will have been addressed or implemented in this report.



Milestone 3 has focused on the development of a set of tasks and potential designs,
encompassing a full cycle of the design diamond (proposing a wide range of ideas, 
then narrowing down to a single design with two focus tasks).
In this milestone report, focus on demonstrating this progression, providing rationale for the choices
made at each step along the way.


This report should have three sections:

1. __Design Problem & Tasks__

   Begin by presenting the iteration of your design problem you used throughout Milestone 3.
   You can use text from a previous submission as a starting point, but ensure that you
   clearly describe your problem and __highlight relevant aspects of it that influenced your
   subsequent design exploration.__

   Next, select a set of six tasks that characterize the design space you explored 
   throughout this milestone. These may be a combination of early tasks from Assignment 3.1,
   revised tasks from Assignment 3.2, refined focus tasks from Assignment 3.4, or previously
   unsubmitted tasks that you feel influenced your design ideation. 

   Regardless of where you take these tasks from, ensure that each task is appropriately formed,
   consisting of a clear action that leads to an accomplishment and is not overly tied to a
   specific design or story.
   *(Revise previously submitted tasks as necessary to ensure this.)*

   Briefly reflect on this set of tasks and share insights you found through your design process. 
   Insights might include:
   - Were there interesting relationships between tasks?
   - Were there tasks that worked particularly well or poorly together? 
   - Did different categories of tasks emerge (e.g., "long-term" vs. "short-term" tasks)? 
   - Were certain tasks more difficult to incorporate into a design than others?

   Share __at least three__ meaningful insights about your tasks.


2. __Proposed Designs__
   
   Present and review each of your proposed designs from Assignment 3.2. 
   For each design, include:
   - A descriptive title and brief textual overview of the design.
   - Visual "Raw Data" of your design, consisting of 2-3 key sketches that communicate
     the most salient aspects of your design. These may be overview sketches, task sketches,
     or new sketches that you feel better communicate the core concept of this design.
      - *Note: If your previously submitted sketches were unclear or did not effectively
        communicate your design, we strongly encourage you to create updated sketches here.*
   - Design Reflection: Summarize any critique you received on the design and your own reflection
     on what did or didn't work with the design. Regardless of whether you chose to pursue
     this design or not, what did the process of developing this design contribute to your 
     selected design?
   
   *Note: even for the designs you opted not to pursue, ensure that your description and 
   sketches still clearly demonstrate the initial vision of each design, revising materials
   from Assignment 3.2 if needed.* 

   {/*

   Following each design, reflect on the critique you received on the design and present your own
   reflection on how you considered it in your final design selection.
   For instance:
    - If you kept portions of this proposed design: what portions did you keep and why?
    - If you made an intentional choice to not explore any parts of this design going forward:
      what informed that decision? What did you ultimately learn from this design?
    - If you selected this design: what insights made you decide this was a good design to
      explore further? (Note that "we didn't like our other ideas" is *not* a sufficient
      rationale-- what makes this design *good?*)

    */}


3. __Selected Design__

   Finally, you will present your selected design, paired with your two focus tasks. 

   Begin by introducing your design with __a compelling, memorable name__ you intend to use for
   it going forward. This should be more than just a descriptor you may have used to distinguish
   the design in Assignment 3.2-- think critically about how you can communicate key aspects of
   your design in just a few words.

   Additionally, provide a two-paragraph description of the problem your design aims to solve 
   (Paragraph 1) and the key approach your design takes to address this problem (Paragraph 2).
   Ensure this description is concise while still providing sufficient detail to an audience
   who has not heard about your project before.

   Present each of your focus tasks and the associated storyboard (revised from Assignment 3.4
   as needed). Ensure that each focus task is clearly stated and that your storyboard presents 
   a compelling narrative involving a problem, at least one character, a clear interaction 
   between a character and your design, and a final outcome that indicates satisfaction
   and explains how the problem was addressed. 
   Be particularly mindful of how you balance conciseness and clarity in each storyboard.

   Next, explain the rationale for selecting your design and your focus tasks. Be sure to speak
   affirmatively about why *this* design and *these* tasks are **good**, not just why the options
   you did not pursue were worse.

   Also discuss the relationship between your design and your tasks and why they "make sense" together. 
   For instance:
   - What synergy exists between your design and tasks? 
   - How do your tasks enable you to explore a meaningful space in this design and tell 
     a compelling story?
   - Are there tasks or portions of your problem not captured by your focus tasks 
     that you intentionally chose not to focus on because of the goals of this design?

   Finally, close by presenting specific details of how you intend to support your tasks
   in this design. For each focus task, share sketches or select frames from your task walkthroughs 
   (from Assignment 3.4) that show your current concept of what the interaction actually looks like.

   Briefly reflect on what you currently know or don't know about your design:
   - What specific elements of the design became clear through producing your task walkthrough?
   - What aspects of this design are still open or uncertain? 
   - What portions of the design do you want to focus on most during the upcoming design refinement
     and usability testing?
