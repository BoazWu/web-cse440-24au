The goal of this milestone is to begin thinking about how to plan effective design research to inform your design process.

Generate 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects of your project proposal:

- Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed (e.g., wearable sensors, watch/phone/tablet, desktop, appliances or other artifacts in the environment).
- Data: types of data a design might track or help a person track.
- Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.
- Features: a specific capability a design might have.
- Social Interactions: types of social interactions and situations a design might engage or support.

We will provide sheets of paper to help structure this brainstorm.
Sketch your ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea.
A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.

The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some individual possibility.
Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea.
You may include ideas from existing products, but no two ideas should be alike.
When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.

After this brainstorming, you will have a broad space of possible directions.
Your project will soon need to gather information on how to generate and consider ideas in such directions.
Following up on the above, additionally brainstorm:

- People: types of people you might work with to learn more about problems and opportunities.
- Focus: what parts of the problems and opportunities you might focus on learning more about.
- Method: how you might engage those people to learn more about problems and opportunities.
