# Milestone 1 Report

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_1_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

TODO: Incorporate due date, which this tag previously did.

The goal of this report is to summarize and communicate how your design process began and evolved throughout Milestone 1.

For this report, you are free to directly reuse content you produced for earlier assignments in this Milestone.
However, you should revise your content as needed to ensure your submission reflects your current thinking.
Relatedly, if you received feedback from course staff previously during this Milestone, it is expected that the feedback will be implemented or addressed in this report.

Milestone 1 has centered on finding your design direction through the process of developing proposals, selecting among them, and doing initial ideation to inform your upcoming design research. In this report, aim to answer the following question: "how did we come to this design direction, and why is it the *right* direction?"

Your report should consist of three sections:

1. __Initial Proposals__

   - Share each of your three proposals from Assignment 1.2.
   Then, for each proposal, synthesize the critique you received on it, as well as your own evolving insights on what does or doesn't "work" in the proposal.


   - **NEW:** Reflect on how these initial proposals informed your final proposal.

     For proposal(s) that directly informed your final proposal: what parts did you keep in the updated proposal, and what did you discard or revise?

     For proposal(s) that did not inform your final proposal: why did you ultimately not go with this idea?

2. __Final Proposal__

   Share the latest version of your proposal. **If you have updated your focus since submitting A1.3, your proposal should be updated accordingly.**

   Include the following information (same prompt as A1.3):

   - Describe the design problem and motivation.
	 State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe an opportunity to enhance an existing practice or approach.
	 Provide enough detail to convince a reader this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.

   - Analyze the idea to give more background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling.
	 Do not just focus on negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain.
	 A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims.
	 If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

	 If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your idea,
	 explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.



3. __Design Directions__

   - Across 2 slides, share 8-10 of your top design ideas from A1.4. 
     On each slide, provide a few specific insights on how some of these ideas could complement each other or introduce meaningful tradeoffs. 

   - **NEW:** At the end of A1.4, you were asked to begin thinking about your upcoming Design Research, focusing on three main dimensions:

   **People:** types of people you might work with to learn more about problems and opportunities.

   **Focus:** what parts of the problems and opportunities you might focus on learning more about.
   
   **Method:** how you might engage those people to learn more about problems and opportunities.

   Briefly address each of these categories and propose one to two specific examples to consider as you plan your Design Research.


## Submission

Submit your report as a slide deck with the following structure:
- __Initial Proposals__
   - For each Proposal from A1.2 (3 total):
      - 1/2 slide: Description of the proposal.
      - 1/2 slide: Synthesis of critique and reflection on this proposal.
   - 1 slide: Reflection on how these proposals informed your final proposal.

- __Final Proposal__
   - 1 slide: Overview of design problem and motivation.
   - 1 slide: Analysis of the problem.

- __Design Directions__
   - Across 2 slides: share 8-10 of your top design ideas from A1.4, with brief design insights on each slide.
   - 1 slide: articulation of People, Focus, and Method for Design Research.
