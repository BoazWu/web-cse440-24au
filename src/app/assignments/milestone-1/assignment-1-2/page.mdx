<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_1_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to propose multiple specific problems that could form the basis of a design project for this class.
Tuesday will then include presenting these for feedback from peers and course staff.

Propose three specific problems that are potentially related to the course theme and could form the basis of a design project for this class.

For each problem, in one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation.
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe an opportunity to enhance an existing practice or approach.
Provide enough detail to convince a reader this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.

Ensure each problem or opportunity is significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.

Ensure it is clear why each idea is potentially related to the course theme.

If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your idea,
explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.
