# Assignment 1.2: Group Proposals

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_1_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

{/*
TODO: Incorporate due date, which this tag previously did.
<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment1b}>
*/}

The goal of this assignment is to propose multiple specific problems that could form the basis of a design project for this class.
Tuesday will then include presenting these for feedback from peers and course staff.

Propose three specific problems that are potentially related to the course theme and could form the basis of a design project for this class.

For each problem, in one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation.
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe an opportunity to enhance an existing practice or approach.
Provide enough detail to convince a reader this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.

Ensure each problem or opportunity is significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.

Ensure it is clear why each idea is potentially related to the course theme.

If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your idea,
explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.

<ExcludedTopics />

## Submission

Submit a slide deck with the following structure:

__Content__:
- For Each Proposal (3 total):
  - 1 slide: description of the proposal

Templates are available in the LINK TBD.

- <GroupAssignment />
- <CanvasGroupsNotCreated />
- <ClarityAndPresentationReference />

Submit via Canvas here:

<AssignmentSubmitCanvasLink assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_1_2} />

## In Class

Be prepared to discuss your three proposed ideas.

Ensure your slide deck is in your team's Google Drive
so you can easily share it with peers for critique.

## Completion Grading

This assignment will be graded on your completion of __5 components__:

1. __Problem and Motivation for Each Unique Proposed Idea__ (3 total):

   Do not submit small variations on the same idea.

   Do not submit ideas within an excluded topic.

   Be clear why each idea offers at least some potential relationship to the course theme.

2. __Novelty and Creativity__:

   If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed idea,
   explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.

3. __Clarity and Presentation__

TODO: Scraps of text.

After receiving critique on Tuesday, update your proposals ahead of additional critique on Friday.

As part of prompting you to deeply engage with and consider critique,
your submitted revision must completely modify at least one of your original ideas
(e.g., replacing at least one idea with a completely different idea,
completely re-writing an idea to emphasize a different perspective).

- After receiving critique on Tuesday, submit an updated version.
  In the same additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement,
  also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you revised it).

We will primarily grade the revised version of your submission,
but may also apply a penalty if the original submission was severely underdeveloped or otherwise problematic.

In the same additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement,
also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you revised it).
