The goal of this milestone is to propose multiple specific problems that could form the basis of a design project for this class.
Tuesday and Friday will then include presenting these for feedback from peers and course staff.

Propose three specific problems that are potentially related to the course theme and could form the basis of a design project for this class.

For each problem, in one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation.
This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.

Ensure each problem or idea is significantly different, not small variations on the same problem or idea.

Ensure it is clear why each problem or idea is potentially related to the course theme.

If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem,
explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.

After receiving critique on Tuesday, update your proposals ahead of additional critique on Friday.

As part of prompting you to deeply engage with and consider critique,
your submitted revision must completely modify at least one of your original ideas
(e.g., replacing at least one idea with a completely different idea,
completely re-writing an idea to emphasize a different perspective).

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your three proposed problems.

Bring several printed copies of your submission,
so you can easily share them with peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

1. __Problem and Motivation for Each Unique Proposed Idea__: (3 x 2 points)

   Do not submit small variations on the same idea.

   Do not submit ideas within an excluded topic.

   Be clear why each idea is potentially related to the course theme.

   Completely modify at least one idea as part of revision after initial critique.

2. __Novelty and Creativity__: (2 points)

   If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem,
   explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.

3. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

   In the same additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement,
   also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you revised it).

We will primarily grade the revised version of your submission,
but may also apply a penalty if the original submission was severely underdeveloped or otherwise problematic.
