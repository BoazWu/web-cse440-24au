The goal of this milestone is to help get you started in thinking of some ideas for a potential projects.
Friday's section will then build on these in brainstorming additional potential directions for project proposals.

Propose three starting points for brainstorming domains, problems, and goals that might be supported via self-tracking.

By domain, we mean an aspect of life. Domains that are already common in self-tracking include:

- finances (e.g., tracking spending, a budget, investments)
- wellness (e.g., tracking physical activity, sleep, weight)
- health (e.g., tracking for post-surgical pain management, allergies or other personal triggers, major weight loss)
- mood (e.g., tracking mood, identifying depressive symptoms)

Be sure to focus on problems and goals, not potential design solutions.
One way to help yourself identify a hierarchy of problems and goals is to ask "Why?". For example:

- Why is a person using a budgeting app?
- Why is a person tracking their spending?
- Why do they want to know how much they spend on leisure activities?
- Why do they have a goal of saving for a major purchase?

Each idea should be just a sentence or two, identifying the domain and the problem, goal, or idea.

Your ideas must be significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.
- At most one of your ideas may come from any of the domains above.
- Your other two ideas should come from two domains that are not in the above list and are different from each other.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __3 points__:

1. __Each Unique Proposed Idea__: (3 x 1 point)

   Do not submit small variations on the same idea.

   Do not submit ideas within an excluded topic.

   Be clear why each idea is potentially related to the course theme.

   At most one of your ideas may come from the domains listed above (i.e., finances, wellness, health, mood).

   Be clear regarding the domain of each idea, ensure each idea is from a different domain.
