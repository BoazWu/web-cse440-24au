# Assignment 1.3: Finalized Proposal

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_1_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to propose and analyze a problem that will form the basis of a design project for this class.
You should build upon the feedback you have received from peers and course staff.
Although your project will iterate and evolve from this point, your group should have coalesced around an idea.

In one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation.
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe an opportunity to enhance an existing practice or approach.
Provide enough detail to convince a reader this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.

In another paragraph, analyze the idea to give more background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling.
Do not just focus on negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain.
A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims.
If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your idea,
explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.
