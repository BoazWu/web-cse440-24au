The goal of this milestone is to propose and analyze a problem that will form the basis of a design project for this class.
You should build upon the feedback you have received from peers and course staff.
Although your project will iterate and evolve from this point, your group should have coalesced around an idea.

In one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation.
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.
Provide enough detail to convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.

In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling.
Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain.
A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims.
If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem,
explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.
