# Milestone 2 Report

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_2_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.


The goal of this report is to communicate and reflect on what you observed and learned in your design research,
including revisiting the formulation of your design problem 
and organizing observations around themes that can help inform your design.

You are free to directly reuse content produced for earlier assignments in this milestone.
However, you should revise content as needed to ensure your milestone report reflects your current work.
Similarly, we expect that feedback received throughout this milestone will have been addressed or implemented in this report.

Milestone 2 has focused on planning, conducting, and synthesizing design research
to inform the design choices you make in the upcoming design development phase.
In this milestone report, aim to communicate how your design research has provided the necessary scaffolding
for you to produce a design that effectively addresses your chosen design problem.


This report should have three sections:

1. __Methods and Participants__

   State your two Design Research Questions and briefly explain how you structured your design research
   in pursuit of answering these questions.
   These questions may be the same as what you submitted in Assignment 2.1, or you may submit
   a revised version of your questions if you updated them before or during your design research.


   Then, present an overview of each design research method you employed.
   Include details about your intended participants and two or more specific details
   of how you implemented your method.


   Next, provide a brief overview of your participants.
   For each design research activity you conducted, describe relevant details of your participant
   (or details of the *group* of participants, if you employed a group-based method such as a survey).
   **Ensure that you do not deanonymize any participantsâ€“ only use pseudonyms when referring to a 
   participant and be careful not to share any personally identifying information.**


   Finally, reflect on the process of conducting your design research.
   What challenges or unexpected opportunities that arose while conducting your research?
   How did the experience differ across participants? If you used multiple methods or updated your
   method across sessions, how did different methods affect the type of information you got?


2. __Design Problem__

   Revisit the Design Problem you submitted in your Milestone 1 Report.
   Having now completed your design research: how has your design problem 
   (or your focus/interest in this problem) changed?

   - Are there specific portions of the original problem that you are now more/less focused on?
   - Did your Design Research surface new, related problems? If so, what are they? Are you choosing to pursue them?

   Justify these changes in focus (or your choice to keep the problem exactly the same) 
   using specific details from your Design Research.


   After completing this reflection, state **the latest version of your Design Problem.** 

   Provide sufficient detail that someone who does not know your work can understand the problem and why it is an important problem.
   However, ensure that your Design Problem is still sufficiently open that it supports multiple distinct designs.


3. __Findings & Themes__

   In Assignment 2.2, you were tasked with developing 6 findings for each of your design research activities.
   Now, you will present just **eight findings total** that represent the strongest insights you derived
   through your design research.

   For each finding, provide a succinct summary of the finding, complemented by specific evidence from one or more
   of your design research activities. This evidence may take the form of a quote, a description of a participant's
   reaction to a question/probe, or any other fact of what happened during your design research that explains
   your finding.


   Finally, synthesize **two higher-level themes** from your design research.
   Each theme should clearly connect to insights from at least two different design research activities.
   For each theme, identify two clear design implications: are there specific characteristics or values 
   suggested by this theme that you should center in your designs?
   Are there relevant tasks surfaced by this theme that a good design might focus on?

   These themes are meant to guide your upcoming design development, so ensure they are appropriately "high-level:" 
   they should provide a clear direction and scaffolding for your design process, 
   while still leaving room for you to explore different designs.


## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.milestone_2_report} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
  Edit the deck in-place, so that you can easily share it in critique.

- Prepare a Slide deck with the following structure:


  Methods and Participants
    - 1 slide: Design research questions
    - 1+ slides: Methods Overview
      
      *(Include 1 slide for each method you employed)*

    - 1 slide: Participant overview
    - 1 slide: Reflection on design research process


  Revised Design Problem
    - 1 slide: Reflection on your original design problem
    - 1 slide: Revised design problem


  Design Directions
    - 4 slides: 8 Design Research Findings *(2 per slide)*
    - 2 slides: 2 Higher-Level Themes *(1 per slide)*


Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

  - Export a PDF of your deck, via the menu: File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf).
