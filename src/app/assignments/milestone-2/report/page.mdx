The goal of this report is to summarize and communicate your development of a project proposal in Milestone 1.

> From Assignment 2d
The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and learned in your design research,
organizing observations around themes and developing insights into tasks that can help inform your design.

You are free to directly reuse content produced for earlier assignments in this milestone.
However, you should revise content as needed to ensure your milestone report reflects your current work.
Similarly, we expect that feedback received throughout this milestone will have been addressed or implemented in this report.

TODO goal text that mirrors Milestone 1 but fits the scope of this milestone.

> From Milestone 1
Milestone 1 has focused on finding your design direction through a process of
developing multiple proposals,
receiving critique on each of them,
integrating that critique to prepare a final proposal,
and doing initial ideation to inform your upcoming design research.
In this milestone report, aim to communicate how you came to your design direction and why it is compelling to pursue.

#### Identifying Themes

Complete design research with a total of at least three participants. Discuss your process and what you learned:

- What did you do?
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.
- What did you learn?
  - List **at least eight** specific findings based on what you observed or learned.
  - For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?

We expect findings will be short but concrete.
For example, findings might be organized as a bulleted list,
where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of the finding
and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that informed that finding.

Although you now have more participants, this milestone asks for relatively few additional findings.
We expect you will curate your findings
(e.g., to focus on those which are most interesting,
to convey the range of things you learned,
to emphasize key themes you have identified).
Some of your specific findings therefore might also have been reported in Assignment 2c,
but others will be new and the overall set will be curated with a focus on advancing your project.

Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices.

- Identify at least two themes or high-level insights that are suggested by your findings across multiple participants.
- Do your findings, themes, and problems suggest tasks that are important to design for?

If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems, and design opportunities,
it may indicate a need to develop additional understanding through more design research.
Because your findings at this point are critical to setting a foundation for your project,
ensure your design research has provided you the insights and perspective you need to proceed.

## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.milestone_2_report} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
  Edit the deck in-place, so that you can easily share it in critique.

- Prepare a Slide deck with the following structure:

<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

{/*
  Initial Proposals
    - For each proposal from Assignment 1.2 (3 total):
      - 1/2 slide: Description of the proposal.
      - 1/2 slide: Synthesis of critique and reflection on this proposal.
    - 1 slide: Reflection on how these proposals informed your final proposal.

  Final Proposal
    - 1 slide: Description of the proposal.
    - 1 slide: Analysis, background, or context for this proposal.

  Design Directions
    - Across 2 slides: 6 to 10 of your top design ideas,
      with brief insights into why they are potentially compelling to explore.
    - 1 slide: Initial proposals for design research people, focus, and method.
*/}

Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

## Grading

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

{/*
This milestone report will be graded on a scale of __20 points__:

1. __Initial Proposals and Critique__: (3 x 1 point)

   Share each proposal, with appropriate summary of and reflection on critique of that proposal.

2. __Reflection on Initial Proposals__: (2 point)

   Provide meaningful insight into rationale for pursuing your final proposal,
   including your decisions and what informed those decisions.

3. __Final Proposal - Problem and Motivation__: (4 points)

   Provide enough detail to convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.

4. __Final Proposal - Analysis of Problem__: (4 points)

   Give enough background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling.

5. __Novelty and Creativity__: (2 points)

   If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed idea,
   explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.

6. __Design Ideation__: (2 points)

   Present a set of your top design ideas and
   a few specific insights into why these ideas are potentially compelling to explore.

7. __Directions for Design Research__: (1 point)

   Provide meaningful ideas for people, focus, and method to consider in design research.

8. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)
