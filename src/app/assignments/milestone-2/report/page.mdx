# Milestone 2 Report

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_2_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

{/* More text from ASSIGNMENT 2D

The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and learned in your design research,
organizing observations around themes and developing insights into tasks that can help inform your design.

#### Identifying Themes

Complete design research with a total of at least three participants. Discuss your process and what you learned:

- What did you do?
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.
- What did you learn?
  - List **at least eight** specific findings based on what you observed or learned.
  - For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?

We expect findings will be short but concrete.
For example, findings might be organized as a bulleted list,
where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of the finding
and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that informed that finding.

Although you now have more participants, this milestone asks for relatively few additional findings.
We expect you will curate your findings
(e.g., to focus on those which are most interesting,
to convey the range of things you learned,
to emphasize key themes you have identified).
Some of your specific findings therefore might also have been reported in Assignment 2c,
but others will be new and the overall set will be curated with a focus on advancing your project.

Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices.

- Identify at least two themes or high-level insights that are suggested by your findings across multiple participants.
- Do your findings, themes, and problems suggest tasks that are important to design for?

If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems, and design opportunities,
it may indicate a need to develop additional understanding through more design research.
Because your findings at this point are critical to setting a foundation for your project,
ensure your design research has provided you the insights and perspective you need to proceed.
