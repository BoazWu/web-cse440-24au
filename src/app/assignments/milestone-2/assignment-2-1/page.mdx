# Assignment 2.1: Design Research Plan

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_2_1} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_2_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>This Assignment is Still Under Development</h4>
<h5 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Text below is from a prior assignment that we expect will inform the details of this assignment.</h5>

The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your design research,
encouraging you to work through details of how you would conduct that research
and improving those details through critique and peer feedback.

As part of Assignment 2, you are required to conduct design research
(e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations)
to learn from at least __three__ people who might use your design.

In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design.
If other people are also likely impacted by a design, also describe these other stakeholders to consider.
Among potential stakeholders, describe the __participants__ you plan to pursue,
including such details as their background and the environment where you will examine their current practices.

- For example, your target participants should not be "doctors" but instead a specific group of doctors
  (e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic).
  Other stakeholders might include patients of the clinic, nurses in the clinic, or non-medical staff in the clinic.

Describe your __recruitment plan__ in enough detail to convince us that you can find and engage with your target participants in the next week.
Whether you intend to target participants that are relatively difficult to access (e.g., as with busy doctors)
or more readily available (e.g., undergraduate students at the University of Washington),
describe your planned recruitment activities,
and when you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.
Additionally describe any steps you have already taken to recruit,
and your plans to recover if recruitment is not initially successful in the necessary timeline.

In another paragraph, describe the __specific design research method(s)__
you will use to engage with and learn from these people and your rationale for choosing these method(s).
A typical expected method would be contextual inquiry with three participants.
However, we encourage you to propose alternative or additional design research methods according to your needs
(e.g., you are welcome but not required to propose to combine multiple methods).
Please be as specific as possible, providing relevant details for you proposed methods. For example:

- If you propose contextual inquiries, discuss current behaviors you want to observe and your planned focus.
- If you propose interviews, discuss the types of questions you plan to explore.
- If you propose a diary study, discuss what type of data you plan to ask participants to bring or collect.

On a second page, provide more detail regarding your primary proposed method. For example:

- If you propose contextual inquiries, enumerate what activities you intend to observe,
  what focus you intend to bring to observation of each activity,
  and any strategies you intend to pursue for gaining insight through your observations.
- If you propose interviews, give an example set of planned talking points.
- If you propose a diary study, give details of what and how you will ask participants to diary.
