# Assignment 2.1: Design Research Plan

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_2_1} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_2_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your design research,
encouraging you to work through details of how you would conduct that research
and improving those details through critique and peer feedback.

As part of Milestone 2, you are required to conduct design research
(e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations)
and conduct at least __three__ design research activities
with people who might use your design.

To start, you will develop two research questions that will guide your design research.
For each question, in 1-2 sentences, summarize what you already know related to this question.
Be careful not to present your personal assumptions as "fact" hereâ€“ however, acknowledging these assumptions as things you think you know but want to get further insight on can still be valuable at this point.

Additionally, provide your rationale for each question (approx. 1 paragraph per question). 
Your rationale should address:
- Why this question is both meaningful and feasible
(i.e., not trivial but not so complicated you cannot explore it in a week)
- 2 or more types of information you could gather to explore this question
- Initial thoughts on how you might incorporate learnings into a design


After developing your research questions, you will then propose one or more design research methods.

First, propose an **interview-based** design research method. 
Provide an overview of this method, including:
- the __participants__ you plan to pursue,
including such details as their background and the environment where you will examine their current practices.
- Style of interview (e.g., traditional 1:1, pair interview, activity & debrief, etc.)
- Additional implementation details (e.g., other specific goals of this method)

Additionally,
describe your __recruitment plan__ in enough detail to convince us that you can find and engage with your target participants in the next week.
Whether you intend to target participants that are relatively difficult to access (e.g., as with busy doctors)
or more readily available (e.g., undergraduate students at the University of Washington),
describe your planned recruitment activities,
and when you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.
Additionally describe any steps you have already taken to recruit,
and your plans to recover if recruitment is not initially successful in the necessary timeline.

After outlining your method, propose a set of __nine interview questions__.
Each question should directly contribute to answering one of your two larger research questions,
but be specific enough that you can imagine a participant being able to answer it.

For some research questions, interview-based methods are not the best or only way to perform design research.
While many 440 projects *are* well-suited to interview-based methods, other methods that have succeeded in the past include:
 - Diary Studies / Experience Sampling
 - Contextual Inquiry / Shadowing
 - Survey Methods
 - Personal Inventory / Artifact Analysis
There are also many other design research methods available to you, which you can find details of in the Design Research Methods lecture or in *Universal Methods of Design* (see Canvas Resources).

Having already proposed an interview-based method, you will now do ONE of the following:

1. Propose an alternate or complementary design research method.

   Describe an alternative design research method you may employ, either alongside or instead of 
   your proposed interview-based method.

   Your description should be 1 slide, including relevant details of:
     - Audience / Intended Participants (+ Recruitment Details, if different from what you described for your interview-based method).
     - Type of information & insights this method would help you acquire.
     - Sample prompts, activities, etc. you might use in implementing this method.

2. OR: Explain your rationale for selecting an interview-based method.

   Even if you end up only conducting your interview-based method,
   it is still important to consider alternate methods and their relative contributions.

   In 1/2 a slide each, discuss __two other design research methods__ from the list above that you 
   have considered and chosen NOT to go forward with.
   For each method, identify at least one asset of your proposed interview method that
   the alternate method does not support.


#### Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_2_1} />

Within the Drive folder for course project files:

- Identify the Slides deck corresponding to this assignment for your group.
  The deck provides a template for this assignment.
  Edit the deck in-place, so that you can easily share it in critique.

- Prepare a Slide deck with the following structure:

  __Research Questions:__
  - 1 slide for each research question (2 slides total), consisting of:
    - Your research question
    - A summary of what you currently know about this topic (e.g., from personal knowledge, from background research)
    - A brief justification of this research question

  __Interview-Based Method:__
  - 1 slide: Method & Recruitment Details
  - 3 slides: 9 possible interview questions (3 per slide)

  __Alternative Method:__
  - 1 slide: 
    - If proposing a different method: Method Description & Implementation Details
    - If NOT proposing a different method: Rationale for Interview Method

Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

  - Export a PDF of your deck, via the menu: File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf).
