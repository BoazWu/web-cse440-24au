# Assignment 2.2: Design Research Check-In

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_2_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>This Assignment is Still Under Development</h4>
<h5 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Text below is from a prior assignment that we expect will inform the details of this assignment.</h5>

The goal of this milestone is to begin your design research,
reflect on what you observe and learn,
then update your plans for additional design research.

Complete design research with at least one participant prior to this check-in.
You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design,
but also about effectively conducting your design research.

Describe your first design research participant and your findings:

- What did you do?
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.
- What did you learn?
  - List **six** specific findings based on what you observed or learned.
  - For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?

We expect findings will be short but concrete.
For example, findings might be organized as a bulleted list,
where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of the finding
and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that informed that finding.

Then discuss what remains to be pursued in your additional design research.
We fully expect changes will be necessary, as design research
can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved.

- Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?
- What are your plans for the remaining participants?
- How do you plan to change your design research plan based on what you learned with your first participant?

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

- <GroupAssignment />
- <ClarityAndPresentationReference />
- <ParticipantAnonymity />

Submit via Canvas here:

<AssignmentSubmitCanvasLink assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_2_2} />

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your design research.

Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four),
so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __8 points__:

1. __Description of Participant__: (1 point)
2. __Specific Findings__: (6 x .5 points)
3. __Plan for Remaining Participants__: (2 points)

   Discuss what remains to be pursued, any challenges encountered, and your updated design research plan.

4. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and learned in your design research,
organizing observations around themes and developing insights into tasks that can help inform your design.

#### Identifying Themes

Complete design research with a total of at least three participants. Discuss your process and what you learned:

- What did you do?
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.
- What did you learn?
  - List **at least eight** specific findings based on what you observed or learned.
  - For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?

We expect findings will be short but concrete.
For example, findings might be organized as a bulleted list,
where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of the finding
and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that informed that finding.

Although you now have more participants, this milestone asks for relatively few additional findings.
We expect you will curate your findings
(e.g., to focus on those which are most interesting,
to convey the range of things you learned,
to emphasize key themes you have identified).
Some of your specific findings therefore might also have been reported in Assignment 2c,
but others will be new and the overall set will be curated with a focus on advancing your project.

Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices.

- Identify at least two themes or high-level insights that are suggested by your findings across multiple participants.
- Do your findings, themes, and problems suggest tasks that are important to design for?

If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems, and design opportunities,
it may indicate a need to develop additional understanding through more design research.
Because your findings at this point are critical to setting a foundation for your project,
ensure your design research has provided you the insights and perspective you need to proceed.
