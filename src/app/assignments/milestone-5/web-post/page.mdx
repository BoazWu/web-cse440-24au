# Assignment 5: Web Post

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

*/}

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_5_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

**Prepare a web post** documenting your design and your design process.
Your post will be integrated into the course website via the
<SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.projectsTop} /> page,
used to both advertise the course poster session and to provide an archive of course projects.
Prior milestones provide significant content you can draw upon in this post,
but this post is intended for an audience of future readers reviewing your design work.
Not all content from prior milestones will be included,
you should update your prior work based on feedback received throughout your design process,
and you will ultimately emphasize a few key insights that most informed your design.

Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate contrast).
Re-make images as necessary to ensure this
(e.g., by taking new photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner,
by re-creating a piece of a paper prototype using ink that will create a better image).

Remember that audience is important in storytelling,
and be sure your post takes a tone of presenting and reflecting on your project.
You are not selling the resulting design, but are instead sharing your work with an interested audience.
You can express enthusiasm, but do not let that enthusiasm undermine the substance of your content.

Your post should follow the outline below.
It will be authored using Markdown and provided components for including images.
Be sure to inspect and understand the template text provided in your project directory.

1. __Title, Logo, and Team__

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea or approach.

   An attractive project logo.
   It will be used to link to your project from the main projects page,
   and you may also choose to include the logo in your post.

   The members of your team.

2. __Problem and Design Overview__:

   **Provide a concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a brief introduction of your design.**
   This might be a single paragraph or two short paragraphs.
   Be sure to include:
   - The problem that motivates your design.
   - The key idea or approach of your design.

   Your goal is to set a context and then to motivate a reader to want to continue to learn about your work.

   - Include an image to help build interest.
     This could be an image that helps introduce the problem and motivation,
     or it could be an image that helps introduce your design (e.g., your logo).

3. __Design Walkthrough__:

   **Within the context of your overall design, introduce your two focus tasks.**
   This should be a single short paragraph.
   Be sure to include:
   - Any context needed to understand your focus tasks in the context of your overall design.
   - A brief motivation or rationale for your design focus on these two tasks.

   Your goal is to motivate these tasks as context for the details of your design.

   - If you have not already included an image to introduce your overall design,
   include such an image as part of this introduction of your design walkthrough.

   **Then present key elements of your design in your two focus tasks.**
   These might each begin with a heading for the task.
   Be sure to include:
   - The tasks that are being accomplished.
   - Images conveying your design in each tasks
     (e.g., as walkthroughs with images from your digital mockup).
   - Enough associated text for a reader to understand the resulting design.

   Your goal is to ensure a person can understand your design and key elements of your task walkthroughs.

   - Do not number your focus tasks (e.g., "Task 1", "Task 2").
     Instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., based on the text of the task itself).

4. __Design Research and Key Insights__:

   **Provide a concise overview of your design research process.**
   This might be a single paragraph.
   Be sure to include:
   - The goals of your design research (i.e., your focus, your primary need for additional understanding).
   - The methods and participants you engaged in your design research.
   - Your rationale (i.e., why you chose your specific methods and participants).

   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   **Then present 3 key insights from your design research process.**
   These might each be a descriptive heading and a single paragraph.
   For each insight, be sure to include:
   - How the insight emerged in your design research
     (e.g., how your understanding was shaped by design research,
     how your understanding was shaped by critique or feedback).
   - Any specific evidence related to the insight
     (e.g., quotes or stories from participants,
     pictures captured during observations,
     pivots in your approach or thinking that resulted from critique or feedback,
     key reasons you chose one design over alternatives,
     key reasons you combined ideas from multiple design alternatives).
   - Any images appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your design sketches).
   - Brief motivation or rationale for emphasizing this insight
     (e.g., how it shaped your design direction or why it was ultimately important to your final design).

   Your goal is to convey key insights from your design research that helped define and differentiate your design.

   - Now that your design is complete, your perspective on prior insights may have evolved.
     You can and should emphasize your current understanding of insights that emerged throughout your design research.
   - Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3").
     Instead give them a descriptive heading
     or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.

5. __Iterative Design and Key Insights__:

   **Provide a concise overview of your iterative design process.**
   This might be a single paragraph.
   Be sure to include:
   First provide a concise overview of your iterative design process in Assignment 3, including:

   - A concise overview of your iterative design process
     (e.g., your paper prototyping, inspection, usability testing, and digital mockup).
   - Brief motivation or rationale for details of your process
     (e.g., how you adapted the process to the needs of your project)
     or reflection on the process
     (e.g., how the process helped surface design insights).

   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   - Include an image of your paper prototype as context for this iterative design
     (e.g., an overview image of your paper prototype).

   **Then present 3 key insights from your iterative design process.**
   These might each be a descriptive heading and a single paragraph.
   For each insight, be sure to include:
   - How the insight emerged
     (e.g., the state of a design element prior to the insight,
     the activity, observation, critique, or feedback that prompted you to iterate upon a design element,
     an aspect of transitioning to a digital mockup that required re-working your design).
   - Any specific evidence related to the insight
     (e.g., quotes from or observations of participants).
   - How you iterated upon the design in response to the insight
     (e.g., showing a design element before and after an iteration).
   - Images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your paper prototyping or digital mockup).

   Your goal is to convey key insights from your iterative design.

   - Now that your design is complete, your perspective on prior insights may have evolved.
     You can and should emphasize your current understanding of insights that emerged throughout your iterative design.
   - Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3").
     Instead give them a descriptive heading
     or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.
