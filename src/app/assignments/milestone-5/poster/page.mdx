# Assignment 5: Poster

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_5_poster_initial} />

Revision Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_5_poster_final} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_5_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to create a poster and a pitch that communicate your design to a broad audience.

**Create a poster** that communicates your design and your design process.
Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects.
Your poster should include:

- Project Title
- Logo
- Your Names
- Problem
- Key Idea or Approach
- Key Functionality
- Key Design Insights

Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text.
For consistency and ease of printing and display, your poster should be 32" x 40" (i.e., portrait, vertical).

The staff have assembled several templates you can use as a starting point:

<CourseDataLink linkKey={courseData.linkFigmaPosterTemplates} outerComponent="p"/>
<p><a href={Paths.basePath + pathPosterTemplateA}>Powerpoint Template A</a></p>
<p><a href={Paths.basePath + pathPosterTemplateB}>Powerpoint Template B</a></p>
<p><a href={Paths.basePath + pathPosterTemplateC}>Powerpoint Template C</a></p>

You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project.

Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate contrast).
Re-make images as necessary to ensure this
(e.g., by taking new photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner,
by re-creating a piece of a paper prototype using ink that will create a better image).

## Poster Session

During the final poster session, your team should be ready
to give a 30-second pitch to a small group of judges.
Prepare a pitch that summarizes the problem and your design.
This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth investigating
and that your design suggests a compelling direction.

The final poster session is not graded, but instead serves as a celebration of your work.

## Submission

Due: <AssignmentDueDateTime assignmentKey={calendarData.assignments.assignment_5_poster_initial} />

Submission via Canvas is required.

Due to frequent challenges in printing, submit both:
- A PDF of your poster.
- The source file for your poster (e.g., a PPTX file, a text file containing a Figma link with edit access).

Be sure:

## In Class

We will bring 8.5" x 11" printed copies of your poster for in-class critique and refinement.

## Completion Grading

Initial submission of this assignment will be graded on completion of the following components:

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

{/*
1. __Design Title & Summary__

   This may be taken directly from Milestone 3,
   or it might have evolved based on what you learned in prototyping..

2. __Overall Completeness and Appropriateness of Paper Prototype__

   Include an overview image of the entire paper prototype
   to convey critical components of your design and the context of your focus tasks.

   If you use an informal drawing tool,
   be sure this overview shows physical copies of your paper prototype available for usability testing.

3. __Focus Task Stories__

   For each focus task,
   include a story that provides context and details for understanding and interacting with your paper prototype.

4. __Focus Task Walkthroughs__

   For each focus task, develop a step-by-step task walkthrough with your paper prototype.
   Include each step in the task, with enough detail to show how to complete each step.

5. __Clarity and Presentation__
