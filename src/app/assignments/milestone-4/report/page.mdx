# Milestone 4 Report

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

This assignment is a component of <SiteLink linkKey={SiteLinks.milestone_4_top}/>.
Be sure you have reviewed that larger context for this assignment.

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

The goal of this report is to communicate your design prototype and its revisions across Milestone 4.

You are free to directly reuse content produced for earlier assignments in this milestone.
However, you should revise content as needed to ensure your milestone report reflects your current work.
Similarly, we expect that feedback received throughout this milestone will have been addressed or implemented in this report.

Milestone 4 has focused on developing a prototype,
testing it through multiple methods,
and revising the prototype accordingly.
In this milestone report, aim to communicate the choices that informed your design choices,
including early incorrect or weak decisions that you later revised.


This report should have three sections:

1. __Initial Paper Prototype__

   Begin by presenting an __overview of your initial paper prototype__ and __walkthroughs of each 
   focus task__ with your paper prototype.
   These can be directly copied from your Assignment 4.1 submission, but ensure each walkthrough
   clearly communicates how the tasks were envisioned in the original prototype.

   Then, __reflect on the process of producing your paper prototype__ from the sketches and storyboards
   you had produced in Milestone 3. 
   Identify at least two explicit design decisions that were made in the process of going from
   sketch to prototype, and describe the rationale for making these specific implementation choices.

2. __Testing Process__

   In this section, you will reflect on the process of testing your prototype and identifying limitations
   or implicit choices in your design that you subsequently revised.

   Begin by reflecting on your __Heuristic Evaluation process__, articulating either 1) what portions of your
   design needed the most work (based on feedback from your Heuristic Evaluations) or 2) what heuristics 
   required the most revision to address. Highlight __at least two__ portions or heuristics you focused 
   on in your revisions.

   Then describe your __Usability Testing process__. 
   In 1-2 paragraphs, share insights on your process, such as:
    - What parts of your design surfaced the most usability issues during testing?
    - Were there any usability issues spread throughout your design that were identified through testing?
    - What takeaways or high-level insights did your testers surface that affected your understanding of
      your design?

   Finally, reflect on __the differences between what was surfaced in Heuristic Evaluation vs. 
   Usability Testing.__ In 1-2 paragraphs, articulate differences in findings across methods, such as:
    - What portions of your design received more feedback with one testing method compared to the other?
    - What types of issues were surfaced in H.E. that weren't surfaced in U.T., or vice versa?
    - Are there issues from U.T. that could have been surfaced in H.E.? What were they, and what heuristics
      would they have related to?

3. __Prototype Revisions__

   For this section, identify __three high-level themes__ that characterize one or more significant issues
   you addressed in your prototype revisions. These may be defined by a single major issue that required
   a major change, or multiple smaller changes that contributed to a larger scale change in the overall usability
   or user experience of your design.

   For each of the issues you identify:
    - Summarize the specific evidence from your Heuristic Evaluations and Usability Tests that informed your
      understanding of this issue.
    - Document the revisions made in support of addressing this issue, including before & after images of your
      prototype illustrating how you considered & addressed this issue.

4. __Final Paper Prototype__

   Finally, present your final paper prototype. Please include:
    - One or more overview photos capturing the overall prototype
    - A task walkthrough for each of your task walkthroughs, explicitly highlighting how your prototype has been
      __revised__ to support completing each task (relative to the task walkthroughs from your initial prototype).

- Prepare a Slides deck with the following structure:

  Initial Paper Prototype
    - 1+ Slides: Initial Paper Prototype Overview
    - Multiple Slides: Focus Task 1 Walkthrough
    - Multiple Slides: Focus Task 2 Walkthrough
    - 1 Slide: Prototyping Reflection

  Testing Process
    - 1 slide: Heuristic Eval Summary
    - 1 slide: Usability Testing Method Overview
    - 1 slide: HE vs. Usability Testing Reflection

  Prototype Revisions
   - For each of 3 Improvements:
     - 1 slide: Testing Takeaway + Summary of Evidence
     - Multiple slides: Related Revisions

  Final Paper Prototype
    - 1+ Slides: Initial Paper Prototype Overview
    - Multiple Slides: Focus Task 1 Walkthrough
    - Multiple Slides: Focus Task 2 Walkthrough


Reminders and requirements:

- Submission via Canvas is also required, in support of grading.
  - Remove instruction slides and template markings from your deck before submission.

  - Export a PDF of your deck, via the menu: File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf).

## Grading

<Alert severity="warning">
<h4 style={{marginTop: 0}}>Assignment Text is Under Development</h4>

{/*
This milestone report will be graded on a scale of __XX points__:

1. __Initial Proposals and Critique__: (3 x 1 point)

   Share each proposal, with appropriate summary of and reflection on critique of that proposal.

2. __Reflection on Initial Proposals__: (2 point)

   Provide meaningful insight into rationale for pursuing your final proposal,
   including your decisions and what informed those decisions.

3. __Final Proposal - Problem and Motivation__: (4 points)

   Provide enough detail to convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.

4. __Final Proposal - Analysis of Problem__: (4 points)

   Give enough background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling.

5. __Novelty and Creativity__: (2 points)
