## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

## Design Walkthrough

The project is about improving cultural exchange by helping travelers and locals connect through shared experiences. To do this, we focused on two main tasks: "Making new friends while traveling" and "Finding locals’ recommendations". These tasks are important because they help people build connections and learn more about each other's cultures. By focusing on these tasks, we aim to make travel more personal and enjoyable for both tourists and locals. Additionally, these tasks encourage collaboration and trust by allowing users to share their own recommendations and join others' activities, creating a sense of community.

### Making New Friends While Traveling

The task of "Make new friends while traveling" is supported by features in our application that lets people easily find and join activities with others. Travelers can browse trips near them, confirm their interest in joining an activity, and send automated messages to connect with the trip organizer. After joining, they can create social posts about their experiences, which are added to their profile for others to see. This helps build connections by showcasing shared activities and encouraging meaningful interactions with other travelers and locals.

    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"340px"}

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Finding Locals’ Recommendations

The task of "Finding Locals’ Recommendations" is supported by features in our application that allow travelers to browse a list of local spots, view their locations on a map, and unlock additional recommendations by sharing their own. People can click on specific pins to see a quick overview, including ratings and reviews from locals, and access detailed information for directions and more insights. This helps travelers discover authentic local experiences, making their trips more engaging and culturally enriching.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P1,
            alt: "Browse local gems",
            caption: "Browse local gems",
        },
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P2,
            alt: "View map of local gems near you",
            caption: "View map of local gems near you",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"360px"}
>
The functionalities shown in the images support the "Finding Locals’ Recommendations" task by providing two main features: a list view and a map view. In the list view, users can browse local gems, including places like parks, restaurants, and breweries, with brief descriptions and pricing details. The map view allows users to explore the locations of these spots visually. Additionally, users are encouraged to contribute to the community by sharing their own local recommendations to unlock access to more suggestions. This design fosters discovery of authentic local experiences while promoting user participation and cultural exchange.
</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P3,
            alt: "Click on a pin to view an overview",
            caption: "Click on a pin to view an overview",
        },
        {
            src: Finding_Local_Recommendations_P4,
            alt: "Click more info for detailed information",
            caption: "Click more info for detailed information",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"360px"}
>
The images illustrate how travelers can interact with pins on the map to access detailed information about local recommendations. By clicking on a pin, travelers see an overview card displaying key details like the venue name, photo, ratings, accessibility information, pricing, and reviews from locals. From the overview card, travelers can either navigate to the location using the "Directions" button or explore further by clicking "More Info." The detailed view provides an expanded profile of the spot, including its address, features (e.g., live music, trivia nights), and additional personal experiences. This functionality enhances the discovery process, allowing travelers to make informed decisions about exploring local gems.
</ProjectImagesBlock>

## Design Research and Key Insights

In our design research, we aimed to understand how travelers discover unique cultural experiences and the barriers they face in finding such activities. We conducted semi-structured interviews and group discussions with participants, including university students, experienced solo travelers, and a group of friends who backpacked together.  We chose these methods for their flexibility, allowing us to adapt questions to participants' experiences and gather rich qualitative insights.  The diverse participants pool helped us explore varying perspectives on cultural immersion and travel planning. Our approach enabled us to identify common themes, such as the importance of social recommendations, the balance between planning and spontaneity, and the role of local insights, all of which informed the focus of our design solution.

### Get Information On Activities From Locals

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: Design_Research_P1,
        alt: "Map of the local activities that can be done nearby",
    }}
    caption={
        "Map of the local activities that can be done nearby"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

Ricky, a UW student, shared that the primary way she found out about fun and interesting cultural experiences was simply by talking to locals. A favorite memory she had was watching a euro cup game where she had been at a bar when the Netherlands won and she felt “ like a small part of ecosystem”. Our application follows Ricky's insight into traveling by displaying a map of local activities that can be done nearby.
<br/>This insight was important for our final design because it helped us restrict the pool of activities that the application recommends to the travelers. Instead of focusing on all potential activities and touristic spots that can be found in a given location, we focus only on activities recommended by local people which are going to enhance the cultural experience of each traveler.

### Sharing Cultural Experiences With Friends Is Essential

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Design_Research_P2,
            alt: "Make social post after the activity is done",
            caption: "Make social post after the activity is done",
        },
        {
            src: Design_Research_P3,
            alt: "Posted activties of each traveler",
            caption: "Posted activties of each traveler",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
Participants often prioritize immersing themselves in local culture but also enjoy describing their cultural encounters to their closest friends. One participant highlighted that sharing these experiences deepens social connections and allows for reflection on what they’ve learned. Our application allows travelers to make a social post after each activity. Moreover, each post gets added to the traveler's profile in order to make it visible to other people.
</ProjectImagesBlock>
This insight allowed us to expand the social capabilities of our application. Not even that the travelers is able to save the activities that they were able to perform within the app, but they are also able to share them to their friends. In this way, our design fosters a community of interconnected travelers that share and encourage each other while expanding their cultural knowledge and meeting new people.

### Spontaneity and Flexibility Are Key Elements in Travel Planning

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: Design_Research_P4,
        alt: "Browse for nearby activities and join them",
    }}
    caption={
        "Browse for nearby activities and join them"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
While participants prefer to plan major activities in advance, they value the ability to adapt to new opportunities as they arise. By dropping pins on Google Maps, like one participant did, they can easily explore nearby activities on the spot. They are also open to changing plans if they discover something more interesting than their original itinerary, prioritizing unique, unplanned experiences. In order to accomplish this task, each traveler is able to browse for nearby activities and join them.
<br/>This insight was able to allow us creating the most important feature of our application, i.e., recommending nearby local activities that are taking place in a group. By trying to integrate the spontaneity and flexibility features, we were able to build the backbone of our application. Moreover, we manage to focus also on the social aspect of the traveling, which enhances the peoples experiences and allow them to find meaningful relationships besides just sightseeing a local objective.
