## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Many dog owners struggle to effectively respond to and manage their dogs' emotional and reactive
behaviors, particularly in high-stress or unexpected situations such as barking at other dog or
behaving abnormally in unfamiliar environments. This issue stems from a lack of tools to help owners
interpret and address their dogs’ behaviors in real-time, compounded by limited opportunities to
learn from these situations to prevent recurrence. This creates challenges in both immediate intervention
and long-term behavior management, leaving owners feeling unprepared and dogs more anxious.

Our approach emphasizes equipping dog owners with the means to respond to immediate behavioral
challenges and reflect on those scenarios for deeper understanding. By focusing on both the reactive
and proactive aspects of behavior management, the design ensures that owners are not only able to
address a situation as it arises but also gain insights into potential triggers and alternatives
for future prevention. This dual focus helps build owners’ confidence in navigating complex
behavioral challenges while fostering a stronger connection with their pets.

## Design Walkthrough

The focus tasks—practicing skills to interpret emotional cues and supporting in-the-moment crisis
response—align perfectly with DogSense MR's dual AR and VR capabilities. The VR practice mode enables
the reflective learning by allowing users to replay past crises and revisit previously encountered
scenarios, learning to identify and interpret signs of anxiety, stress, or aggression in a safe
environment. The AR mode on Orion glasses enables real-time detection of behavioral cues and
crisis triggers during live interactions with the dog, guiding the user to de-escalate or manage
situations effectively as they happen. Together, these tasks create a well-rounded system that not
only enhances immediate response but also builds foundational knowledge and confidence in understanding
dog behavior. The synergy between this design and the focus tasks lies in how AR and VR complement
each other to offer hands-on learning and real-time support, making it easier for dog owners to
confidently manage their pets’ behaviors in various real-world contexts.

### Integrating Two Functionality Workflow into One Homepage

            src: insights1before,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "Post-practice feedback screen where the vague 'Good Job' message is " +
                     "displayed without any additional description or summary after the practice."
        },
        {
            src: insights1after,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "These are two images stacked in a column. " +
                     "Notice that the text on the left is not broken up by the images."

In our initial paper prototype, users were required to navigate between two distinct
interfaces to accomplish both of our focused tasks, which significantly disrupted the
user experience. This separation not only created confusion but also introduced unnecessary
complexity into the usability of the system. Observations during usability testing indicated
that this disjointed interaction model led to frustration and a decreased likelihood of task
completion.

To address these issues, our digital mockup underwent a redesign where both key
functionalities—"Monitor in Real-Time" and "Practice Your Skills"—were integrated
on the homepage. This strategic integration fosters a more cohesive and streamlined
user experience by eliminating the need to switch contexts. Users can now seamlessly
choose between immediate assistance or proactive skill enhancement without navigating
away from the main interface. This design choice not only simplifies the navigation
process but also enhances the overall accessibility of the application. It allows
for a more personalized and intuitive interaction with the system, significantly
improving user engagement and satisfaction. By consolidating these features, the
redesigned interface directly supports users in efficiently achieving their intended
goals, thereby enhancing the practical utility and user-friendliness of our application.

### Improving Navigation and Enhancing User Control

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insights2before,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: insights2after,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "This caption is applied to the entire block of images. " +
        "See that it spans across the area of the images."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

During heuristic evaluations, it was evident that the prototype lacked an undo or exit button
after the users made a selection like "Shaking" or "Dog Bark." This omission restricted users
from backing out or changing their decisions after initiating a process, leading to increased
frustration and a lack of sense of control. The absence of these buttons violated the User Control
and Freedom heuristic, as users were unable to navigate freely or correct mistakes within the interface.

To address this, we added a clear 'Back/Exit' button in the revised design. This enhancement
not only aligns with the User Control and Freedom heuristic but also significantly improves the
overall user interface by making navigation more intuitive and user-friendly.

### Adding Detailed Feedback and Performance Summary

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: insights3before,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "Post-practice feedback screen where the vague 'Good Job' message is " +
                     "displayed without any additional description or summary after the practice."
        },
        {
            src: insights3after,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "These are two images stacked in a column. " +
                     "Notice that the text on the left is not broken up by the images."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

The usability tests revealed that the feedback provided to users after completing practice sessions
was vague and lacked actionable insights. Users were presented with generic messages like "Good Job!"
without any detailed breakdown of their performance or suggestions for improvement. This lack of meaningful
feedback violated the Visibility of System Status and Feedback heuristic, as it failed to communicate to
users how well they performed and how they could improve. The absence of actionable information hindered
the learning process, leaving users unable to gauge their progress or identify areas requiring attention.

To address this shortfall, the feedback mechanism was overhauled to include both positive reinforcement
and constructive suggestions. Now, post-training feedback not only praises correct actions, such as
identifying early signs of anxiety with statements like "You identified early signs of anxiety correctly.
Great work!", but it also points out specific areas for improvement, such as "Focus on noticing tail
movements earlier," accompanied by actionable advice.
