## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Our design problem centers on the potent combination of accessibility, appeal, and addiction potential within online gambling platforms, especially for college students. Statistics show that this demographic is three times more likely to develop gambling addictions compared to other U.S. adults, highlighting a critical vulnerability. Despite the prevalence of gambling among young adults, many gamblers lack easy access to tools that help them visualize and understand their personal gambling behaviors and trends over time. Without this self-awareness, it’s difficult for individuals to identify and curb potentially harmful patterns.
Additionally, gambling sites often employ sophisticated, predatory tactics—such as tailored advertisements, reward structures, and endless play options—that actively encourage extended engagement and spending, exacerbating the risk of addiction. These tactics foster an environment where people are subtly drawn into gambling as a habit, making it increasingly difficult to moderate or quit without external support. Addressing this issue requires a design that empowers gamblers with accessible, meaningful insights into their own behaviors, helping them make informed decisions and avoid the pitfalls of addiction in an environment designed to captivate.


BetBreaker is a popup screen web extension that appears on internet browsers when a user opens gambling sites on their laptop or pc. This pop-up screen will not always be visible, but will track and display the user’s decision making habits, such as actions that impact their own personalized spending limits, daily/weekly/monthly/yearly betting figures, and the user’s risk and odds per bet placed. In addition to helping users responsibly track their finances through easily digestible visualizations of their betting statistics, BetBreaker’s design intends to promote mutual accountability with peers while gambling. By integrating a supportive community-based system to deter financial irresponsibility and impulsivity, namely through approving one another’s bets before being placed, we intend to reinforce users with awareness and transparency of their financial and behavioral habits such that they are aided in knowing when to walk away from the vice of gambling. BetBreaker essentially aims to step away from the issue of curbing gambling addiction outright, and rather instill mindfulness behavior in its users.

We decided to merge the previous budget tracking and statistics tracking tasks together, as they go hand in hand. With this merging of tasks, we intend to demystify to the user how their money is being spent, and educate them along the way. Within budget and statistics tracking, the user will be informed of what is classified as a “good” or “bad” bet statistically by the monetary risk associated with it, with due consideration to their limits and habits. The virtual credit card will be central to the budget tracking aspect, and will give users a more concrete representation of limits.

### Mutual Accountability with Friends

We chose to focus on allowing users to hold accountability with their peers regarding their gambling habits. We intend to focus on this task to boost mindfulness in a way that may help users their curb gambling temptations before they transpire into a larger issue at hand. Rather than focusing on the behemoth of gambling addiction, it appears that holding one another socially accountable of gambling tendencies may prove to be more effective than constant educational reinforcement before placing bets. Coupled with betting limits, users may find it less appealing to gamble impulsively if they know their peers will check in on their spending habits and loss data (and vice-versa).

## Design Research and Key Insights

Our design research process was multifaceted, and involved much revision and changes 
as we went through the process. First we started with design research interviews with 
participants within our target demographic. The purpose of these was to try and find out what kind of overall design users would be
comfortable with, and which functionalities we should or shouldn't implement into the system. We then created multiple designs, to fit 
the participants' desired functionalities. After brainstorming and intentional selection we decided on the web extension design. 
We then conducted usability tests on this design informing the participants about the tasks we desire them to complete, and informing them
of the context in which they are using our application. In doing these tests, we revised our design after each subsequent test, eventually
coming to a revised final paper prototype. Along the process of conducting usability tests, we also used heuristic evaluations from our peers
to find any specific defects within our product, revising these issues before and after we conducted the usability tests.

### Usability Testing

From our usability tests, we also learned that the users did not like having the all the information condensed into one space, as it was harder to differentiate between information, and also just to see in general, they asked, ‘why not just make a whole website’.
We also learned after making our revisions and making a whole website that the friends system needed some modifications, that having a leaderboard among your friends might encourage the wrong behaviors, and also it may discourage from friends participating in mutual accountability if they are at the bottom, additionally having shame buttons next to friends was also too discouraging, and also we needed to make adding friends and messaging friends more straightforward.
We also learned that the users would want more ways to hold their friends accountable, originally one of the reviewers suggested that we make a system where users can require approval from one of their friends before making a bet, which was then tested and then updated so that the users could have a minimum, so that they would only require approval on bets above a certain amount


### Heuristic Evaluation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "This caption is applied to the image. Each can have a different caption.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We learned from our Heuristic Evaluators that we needed to expand on some of the ideas that we had in the paper prototype, meaning that some of the information was too condensed in the paper prototype, and needed to be expanded into a full website. 
We also learned that there was not much user freedom within our paper prototype, for example, we had almost no back buttons, and each tab was hidden within a specific series of subsequent tasks that the user had to complete in the perfect order otherwise they wouldn’t get to the destination.
We also learned that much of the language that we used was not necessarily friendly to users who aren’t familiar with gambling terminology, and considering how our target audience is novice gamblers, we need to have more user friendly terminology, and/or explanations for what the terminology means.
