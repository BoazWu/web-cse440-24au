## Contribution Statements

With each milestone report, group members will individually submit a contribution statement.

This statement should indicate the name of each member of your team (i.e., including yourself),
the percentage of effort that each member contributed across the assignments for that milestone,
and a corresponding list of specific activities.

An example contribution statement might be:

*Group Name*, *Milestone Name*

- *Your Name*: 25%:
  Researched the background of the problem,
  outlined the content of the A2.1 Research Plan document,
  compiled the first version of the Milestone Report,
  selected the images to be included.
- *Name*: 20%:
  Conducted 3 interviews (with *Name*) and took notes.
- *Name*: 15%:
  Wrote the first version of the interview protocol,
  made sure all assignments were submitted.
- *Name*: 30%:
  Organized group meetings,
  conducted 3 interviews (with *Name*),
  edited and finalized the Milestone Report.
- *Name*: 10%:
  Revised the interview protocol.

Contribution statements are intended to support your own reflection,
team discussion of contributions, and staff awareness of your efforts.
The staff does not necessarily expect each person to contribute equally to each assignment,
but does expect all members will appropriately contribute over the quarter and will work as a team to support each other.
The staff also understands that percentages are incomplete and subjective,
so we gather them only as a summary indication and do not use them directly in any grade calculation.

If you at any time feel there is a challenge of contribution within your team,
you may email the course staff.
If you submit a contribution statement that you feel indicates a challenge of contribution within your team,
also email the course staff to call attention to that submission.

In addition to contribution statements at each milestone,
we will separately solicit overall project team feedback twice in the project sequence.
