## Contribution Statements

With each milestone report, group members will individually submit a contribution statement.

This statement should include three components:

1. Overall Breakdown

   Indicate the name of each member of your team (including yourself) and
   the percentage of effort that each member contributed across the assignments for that milestone.

   Each Contribution Statement __must__ include a percentage breakdown.

2. Group Check-in

   We expect all group members to contribute roughly equally across each milestone,
   but understand there are times that that does not happen.

   If any of your group members contributed notably more or less than others 
   during a milestone, please briefly describe that here.

   Additionally, if there are any challenges with team dynamics you would like staff to check in on
   or just be aware of, you can also share that here.

   If there is not anything notable to check in on, you are welcome to leave this section blank.


3. Individual Check-in

   If there are any factors that have affected your individual contribution during this milestone
   that you would like the staff to be aware of, we encourage you to share them here.
   Additional context, such as whether your group members are aware of this situation,
   is also useful for helping the course staff support all group members. 

   If you anticipate continued challenges on future milestones, we encourage you to reach out
   via email as soon as possible.

   If there is not anything notable to check in on, you are welcome to leave this section blank.


An example contribution statement might be:

*Group Name*, *Milestone Name*

__Overall Breakdown__
- *Your Name*: 25%
- *Name*: 20%
- *Name*: 15%
- *Name*: 30%
- *Name*: 10%

__Group Check-in__
Overall this milestone went smoothly, *Name* really took the lead on conducting our design research
and did a great job with it! *Other Name* was less involved in conducting the design research, but
they communicated this clearly so it wasn't a problem.

__Individual Check-in__
Nothing to report!



Contribution statements are intended to support your own reflection,
discussion of team dynamics, and staff awareness of your efforts.
The staff does not necessarily expect each person to contribute equally to each assignment,
but does expect all members will appropriately contribute over the quarter and will work as a team to support each other.
The staff also understands that percentages are incomplete and subjective,
so we gather them only as a summary indication and do not use them directly in any grade calculation.

If you at any time feel there is a challenge of contribution within your team,
you may email the course staff.
If you submit a contribution statement that you feel indicates a challenge of contribution within your team,
also email the course staff to call attention to that submission.

In addition to contribution statements at each milestone,
we will separately solicit overall project team feedback twice in the project sequence.
