## Contribution Statements

With each Milestone Report, all group members will individually submit a contribution statement.

This statement should indicate the name of each member of your team (including yourself),
the percentage of effort that each member contributed across the assignments for that Milestone,
and a corresponding list of specific activities.

An example contribution statement might be:

- *Your Name*: 25%: Researched the background of the problem, outlined the content of the A2.1 Research Plan document, compiled the first version of the Milestone Report, selected the images to be included.
- *Groupmate 1*: 20%: Conducted 3 interviews (with *Groupmate 3*) and took notes.
- *Groupmate 2*: 15%: Wrote the first version of the interview protocol, made sure the final documents were submitted.
- *Groupmate 3*: 30%: Organized the group meeting, conducted 3 interviews (with *Name 2*), edited & finalized the Milestone Report.
- *Groupmate 4*: 10%: Revised the interview protocol.

Contribution statements are intended to support your own reflection as a team as well as staff awareness of your efforts.
The staff does not necessarily expect each person to contribute equally to each assignment,
but does expect all members will appropriately contribute over the quarter and will work as a team to support each other.
The staff also understands that percentages are incomplete and subjective,
so we gather them only as a summary indication and will not use them directly in any grade calculation.

If you feel your team's contribution statement does not appropriately convey team contributions, you may email the course staff.
If you feel a member of your team is not contributing appropriately, you may email the course staff.

We will also separately solicit confidential project team feedback twice in the project sequence.
