## Contribution Statements

Together with each milestone report,
group members will individually submit a contribution statement focused on assignments in the milestone.

A contribution statement should include three components:

1. Overall Percentage Breakdown

   List the name of each member of your team (i.e., including yourself).
   Indicate the percentage of effort each member contributed across the milestone.

   Each contribution statement must include a percentage breakdown.

2. Group Check-In

   We understand, and expect that you will understand,
   that different group members will have different constraints throughout the course.
   We do not necessarily expect all group members to contribute equally to each assignment,
   but do have a greater expectation that contributions will "even out"
   according to the larger timeframe of each milestone.
   If this does not happen, it is important to understand whether there is an issue in group dynamics
   (e.g., so you can address any issue, so you can engage staff if appropriate).

   If any of your group members contributed notably more or less than others across a milestone,
   please briefly describe your perspective on that.
   This might be strong praise for a perceived strong contributor,
   or it might be a reflection of your perspective on a perceived low contributor.

   Additionally, if there are any challenges with team dynamics
   where you would like staff to be aware or to consider engaging, you can also share that here.

   If there is nothing notable on which to check in,
   you can simply indicate that you feel things are going as expected.

3. Individual Check-In

   If you would like the staff to be aware
   of any factors that impacted your individual contribution during this milestone,
   we encourage you to share them here.
   Additional context,
   such as your expectation of confidentiality and whether your group members are aware of any situation,
   is also useful for helping the course staff support all group members. 

   If there is nothing notable on which to check in,
   you can simply indicate that you feel things are going as expected.

An example contribution statement therefore might be:

  > *Group Name*, *Milestone Name*
  >
  > *Your Name*
  >
  > __Overall Breakdown__
  > - *Your Name*: 25%
  > - *Name*: 20%
  > - *Name*: 15%
  > - *Name*: 30%
  > - *Name*: 10%
  >
  > __Group Check-in__
  >
  > Overall this milestone went smoothly,
  > *Name* really took the lead on coordinating our design research and did a great job with it!
  > *Other Name* was less involved in conducting the design research,
  > but they communicated this clearly and it was not a problem.
  >
  > __Individual Check-In__
  >
  > I was sick during the first week of the milestone,
  > but communicated that to my group and then worked to catch up in the second.

If there is anything in your contribution statement that suggests a challenge in contribution
(e.g., in your breakdown, in your group check-in comments, in your individual check-in comments),
or if there is anything that leads you to anticipate continued challenges in future milestones,
we encourage you to reach out via email to the course staff.
Contribution statements are intended to support your own reflection
and to pro-actively gather everybody's perspective,
but an email to the course staff will help ensure prompt engagement with this information.

The staff also understands that percentages are incomplete and subjective,
so we gather them only as a summary indication and do not use them directly in any grade calculation.

In addition to contribution statements at each milestone,
we will separately solicit overall project team feedback twice in the project sequence.
